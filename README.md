# C++ Application Development Course

A self-study course in application development with modern C++ (C++23). You learn the language, object lifetime and ownership, templates and concepts, error handling, concurrency, desktop user interfaces, and network services. You also learn how to design software that is easy to change: the SOLID principles, other design principles, design patterns, architecture, testing, and professional practices. You build a real application: a chess engine with a command-line interface, a desktop user interface, and an HTTP interface with Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSocket.

- **For:** anyone who can program in at least one language. You do not need to know C++.
- **Environment:** a computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux. All tools are free. You select your compiler, build system, editor, and library management method. See [docs/software-setup.md](docs/software-setup.md).
- **Time:** approximately 7–8 months for phases 0–8 at 6–8 hours per week. Phase 9 is open-ended.

You can use the course alone, or with an AI coding agent as your mentor. The mentor assesses your knowledge, adapts the explanations to your background and your tools, reviews your code and your design, and tracks your progress. At the start of each phase and topic, the mentor tells you what you learn, where it is used, and what problem it solves. At the end of each topic, session, and phase, the mentor tells you how well you did, what your gaps are, what to improve, and what is next.

## Quick start with an AI mentor

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ethno2405/cpp-course.git
   cd cpp-course
   ```

2. Open an AI coding agent in the repository root. The agent must be able to read and write files and run commands. Examples: Claude Code (`claude`), OpenAI Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot in agent mode, Cursor, Gemini CLI. The agent reads its instructions from [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (Claude Code reads [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), which imports `AGENTS.md`).

3. Type the first prompt:

   ```
   Start the course.
   ```

4. The mentor offers three assessment modes. Select one:

   | Mode | Time | Content |
   |---|---|---|
   | Quick | ~5 minutes | Questions about your background only |
   | Standard | ~15–20 minutes | Background questions and a short adaptive quiz |
   | Full | ~45 minutes | Background questions, a longer quiz, and practical items (code reading, a design review) |

5. The mentor asks about your project. The documents use a chess engine. You can select a different domain, for example a personal finance ledger or a key-value store. If you do not know, the mentor uses the chess engine.

6. The mentor helps you select your toolchain: the compiler, the build system, the library management method, the test framework, and the editor. If you do not know, the mentor uses the defaults of the course. You can postpone this step to phase 0.

7. The mentor makes your track branch, `track/<YYYY-MM-DD>`, with the start date in the name (for example `track/2026-10-22`). It saves your profile and your progress in the `learner/` directory on this branch. Then it tells you where to start.

In each later session, open the agent in the repository root and type `Continue the course.` The agent has no memory of earlier sessions. It finds your track branch, and reads your profile and progress from `learner/`.

## Your data

- The `learner/` directory contains `profile.md` (background, levels, project, toolchain, environment, preferences, mentor observations) and `progress.md` (position, completed work, notes, the newest session log entries). Older session log entries go to `session-log-archive.md`.
- The `labs/` directory contains your code. From phase 8, `.github/workflows/` contains your CI pipeline.
- You can read and edit all files. The mentor uses the content that it finds.
- **Do not use real personal data in the labs.** The `.gitignore` file ignores database files, build directories, and `.env` files.

### Branches

The `master` branch is the course baseline. It contains only the course documents. Each learner has a track branch `track/<YYYY-MM-DD>` that contains the course documents, the learner data, and the code of one learner. The date is the start date. The branch name contains no personal data.

| Branch | Content |
|---|---|
| `master` | Course documents |
| `track/<YYYY-MM-DD>` | Course documents, `learner/`, `labs/`, and `.github/workflows/` |

- At the end of each session, the mentor asks whether you want to commit your data and code. It commits only on your track branch.
- On `master`, the file `learner/.gitignore` ignores all files in `learner/`, so the files cannot go to `master` by accident. When the mentor makes a track branch, it clears this file in the first commit of the branch. After that, git tracks the learner data on the branch.
- The mentor pushes only when you agree, and only to a remote that you own (for example your fork), or to a remote where the owner permits track branches.
- **Your profile contains personal data.** All persons who can read the remote can read your track branch. If the course repository is public, push your track branch to a private repository (see "Share your data with git").
- Never merge a track branch into `master`.

### Get course updates

The course documents change on `master`. To get the changes on your track branch, merge `master`:

```sh
git switch master
git pull                       # if master has a remote
git switch track/<YYYY-MM-DD>
git merge master
```

A track branch does not change the course documents, so the merge has no conflicts.

### Share your data with git

**Private repository** (do this one time if the course repository is public):

1. Make a new, empty, private repository, for example on GitHub. GitHub does not permit a private fork of a public repository.
2. Add the private repository as a second remote: `git remote add private <url>`.

Push `master` to `origin`. Push your track branches to `private`. To share a track with a different person, give that person access to the private repository. If the course repository is private, you do not need a second remote. Use `origin` in place of `private` in the commands below.

**Send** (from the old clone or computer):

1. End the session with `Save my progress and end the session.` The mentor updates your data and offers to commit it.
2. Push your track branch: `git push -u private track/<YYYY-MM-DD>`.

**Receive** (in the new clone, or for a different person):

1. Clone the course repository. Add the private remote (`git remote add private <url>`), and fetch: `git fetch private`.
2. Switch to the track branch: `git switch track/<YYYY-MM-DD>`. Git makes a local branch from `private/track/<YYYY-MM-DD>`.
3. Start the agent and type `Continue the course.` The mentor continues from the "Current position" in `progress.md`.

To see all track branches, run `git branch -a --list "track/*" "*/track/*"`.

**Before you switch branches,** commit your changes. If `learner/` contains files other than `.gitignore` on `master` (local data from an older version of the course), copy the directory to a safe location first. A checkout can overwrite ignored files and does not give a warning.

**Partial data:**

| The branch contains | Result |
|---|---|
| `profile.md` and `progress.md` | The mentor continues where you stopped. |
| Only `progress.md` | The mentor looks for an earlier version in the git history. If there is none, it keeps your position and offers a short assessment to rebuild your profile. |
| Only `profile.md` | The mentor looks for an earlier version in the git history. If there is none, it asks for your current phase and completed exercises, and makes a new progress file. |
| Nothing | The mentor asks whether you started before. If not, it starts a new assessment. |

**Course version:** the progress file refers to phase and exercise numbers. If you merge a different version of the course documents, the mentor checks the position and corrects it with you.

## Start from scratch

The easiest way: make a new track branch from `master`. Your old branch does not change.

```sh
git switch -c track/<YYYY-MM-DD> master   # use the date today
echo "# Track learner data on this branch." > learner/.gitignore
git add -- learner/.gitignore
git commit -m "Track learner data on this branch"
```

**With the mentor:**

```
Reset the course. I want to start from scratch.
Reset only my progress.
Delete my code in labs/ and start phase 2 again.
```

The mentor asks what to reset (profile, progress, code, or all), shows what it will delete, and offers a backup. It deletes nothing before you confirm. It resets only a track branch, never `master`. The backup is a git tag `<branch>/backup-<date>`, for example `track/2026-10-22/backup-2026-11-02`.

**Without the mentor** (run in the repository root, on your track branch):

Bash:

```sh
git tag "$(git branch --show-current)/backup-$(date +%F)"   # optional backup of committed data and code
git rm -r -q --ignore-unmatch -- learner/profile.md learner/progress.md labs .github/workflows   # delete profile, progress, and code
rm -rf learner/profile.md learner/progress.md labs .github   # delete the remaining local files
git commit -m "Remove learner data to start the course again"
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
git tag "$(git branch --show-current)/backup-$(Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd)"   # optional backup of committed data and code
git rm -r -q --ignore-unmatch -- learner/profile.md learner/progress.md labs .github/workflows   # delete profile, progress, and code
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force learner/profile.md, learner/progress.md, labs, .github -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue   # delete the remaining local files
git commit -m "Remove learner data to start the course again"
```

Uncommitted changes are lost. Commit them before the reset if you want to keep them in the backup tag. Skip the `git commit` command if the branch had no committed learner files.

## Use fewer tokens

An AI agent has usage limits, or a price for each token. To use fewer tokens, keep sessions short: do one topic or one exercise in one session, then start a new session. The mentor gives you one tip at the start of each session. All tips are in [docs/token-usage.md](docs/token-usage.md).

## Use the course without an AI mentor

Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). It has the roadmap, and each phase document has its reading, exercises, and done criteria. Read [docs/software-setup.md](docs/software-setup.md) first and select your toolchain.
